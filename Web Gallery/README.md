Web Gallery application where users can share pictures and comments. 
This application is similar to existing web applications such as Facebook (the photo album part), Picasa or Flickr.

Each user will now has his/her own gallery. Users will be authenticated through the API (local authentication based on sessions). In addition of supporting these feature, access to the API is ruled by the following authorization policy:

Non authenticated cannot read any picture nor comment
Non-authenticated can sign-up and sign-in into the application
Authenticated users can sign-out of the application
Authenticated users can browse any gallery
Gallery owners can upload and delete pictures to their own gallery only
Authenticated users can post comments on any picture of any gallery
Authenticated users can delete any one of their own comments but not others
Gallery owners can delete any comment on any picture from their own gallery

In this app:
HTTPS enabled to prevent eavesdropping and spoofing attacks
All usersâ€™ inputs validated to prevent content spoofing and cross-site scripting attacks
Cookies secured to prevent mixed-content attacks
